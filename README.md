## Project Overview
- Use predictive analytics to identify which Telco customer will churn or not based on features like Gender, SeniorCitizen, MultipleLines, etc.
- The dataset can be obtained [here from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) is used to assist this project with Data Mining by extracting important insights using: 
  - [Basic Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics)
  - [Data Visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_and_information_visualization)
  - [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis)
  - [Supervised Machine Learning Models (Classification)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning)
    - [Support-Vector Machine (SVM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine)
    - [Logistic Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression)
    - [Random Forest Classifier (Bagging Ensemble Model)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest)
    - [XGBoost Classifier (Gradient Ensemble Model)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XGBoost)



### Aim & Objective
- Aim: 
  - To improve the process of analysing customer churn in the Telcomunications industry so that it can focus on maintaining long-term relationships with loyal customers while also developing an effective prediction model that divides Telco customers into churners and non-churners. 
- Objective: 
  - To create and select the best Machine Learning model that classifies Telco customers as actual churners or not based on the importance of data variables and models evaluation and assessment (i.e. Accuracy, Recall, AUC, etc.).
  - The insights and variables gained may be utilised to make better choices and adjustments, such as adding or upgrading services to decrease churn and measuring the success of marketing and other customer acquisition methods and techniques.
